# Project Overview: Deploying a Node.js Application with an Nginx Proxy Server

In this project, I set out to deploy a Node.js application running on port 3000 and configure an Nginx server as a reverse proxy to manage incoming requests. The Node.js server serves as the application server where the core application logic executes. This logic, written in simple JavaScript, displays the running processes within the Node.js runtime.

### Project Goals
- **Set up a Node.js application**: Develop and deploy a Node.js application that listens on port 3000 and provides information about the running processes.
- **Configure Nginx as a reverse proxy**: Set up an Nginx server to act as a reverse proxy, forwarding incoming HTTP requests to the Node.js application.
